# Full Stack Next.js E-Commerce
### This repository contains the code for the Full Stack Next.js E-Commerce project, developed as part of a Hackathon challenge. The project is a full-stack e-commerce application built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI.

Here is the live link (there were some issue in deployment on vercel that's why its not live right now, I'll fix it soon) [online-store](https://online-store-mbs.vercel.app/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel
